## Project Context
You are assisting a data analyst who is building a portfolio of projects, starting with a capstone project for the banking AML (Anti-Money Laundering) industry. The user has strong skills in SQL (SQL Server, PostgreSQL), Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib), Excel, and Power BI, and wants to focus on data-driven insights and analysis, especially using SQL, but also leveraging Python for EDA and visualization.

## Instructions for Copilot
- Always remember the userâ€™s background and goal: to solve realistic, complex data analysis projects for their portfolio, starting with AML in banking.
- Prioritize SQL-based analysis, but also provide Python-based EDA and visualization when appropriate.
- When breaking down tasks, use a step-by-step, chunked approach, and guide the user through realistic project workflows.
- When creating or editing files, use best practices for data analysis projects (clear folder structure, documentation, sample data, and reproducible scripts).
- For any future requests, always consider the context of building a data analyst portfolio with a focus on real-world, industry-relevant problems.

## Project Structure
- /sql_scripts: SQL schema, queries, and analysis scripts
- /sample_data: CSV or SQL files for sample data
- /notebooks: Python notebooks for EDA and visualization
- /docs: Documentation and project reports
- README.md: Project overview and instructions

## Communication
- Keep explanations concise and actionable.
- Guide the user through each step, confirming before moving to the next major phase.
- Always relate analysis and recommendations to AML and data-driven insights.
