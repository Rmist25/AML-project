# AML Banking Capstone Project: Business Scenarios & Rationale

## 1. Project Overview
Money laundering is a critical risk for banks, exposing them to regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and financial loss. This project aims to leverage data analysis to detect suspicious activities and support the bankâ€™s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts.

## 2. Business Objectives
- Identify and analyze transaction patterns indicative of money laundering.
- Provide actionable insights to AML investigators for prioritizing cases.
- Enhance compliance with regulatory requirements and reduce risk exposure.

## 3. Why This Matters
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Banks are required by law to monitor and report suspicious activities.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Early detection of money laundering reduces financial and reputational risks.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Data-driven insights help AML teams focus on the most critical cases.

## 4. Key Business Scenarios Addressed
### a. Structuring (Smurfing)
Criminals break large transactions into smaller ones to avoid detection. Detecting such patterns helps the bank comply with reporting requirements and disrupt illicit activities.

### b. Rapid Movement of Funds (Layering)
Funds are quickly moved between accounts or across borders to obscure their origin. Identifying these patterns is crucial for uncovering complex laundering schemes.

### c. Dormant Account Reactivation
Sudden activity in previously dormant accounts can signal attempts to launder money through less scrutinized channels.

### d. Unusual Beneficiary Patterns
Frequent or unusual changes in beneficiaries may indicate attempts to disguise the true recipient of funds.

### e. High-Risk Country Transactions
Transactions involving high-risk jurisdictions require enhanced due diligence and monitoring.

### f. Repeated Failed KYC Updates
Customers who avoid updating KYC information may be attempting to evade scrutiny, warranting further investigation.

## 5. How This Project Helps
- **Improved Detection:** Advanced analytics and EDA highlight suspicious behaviors that may be missed by rule-based systems.
- **Prioritization:** Insights enable AML teams to focus on high-risk cases, improving investigation outcomes.
- **Scalability:** The approach can be adapted to new threats and regulatory changes, supporting long-term compliance.
