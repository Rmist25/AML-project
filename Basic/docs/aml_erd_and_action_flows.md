# AML Banking Capstone Project: Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## 1. Core Entities & Their Business Meaning

- **customers**: Represents individual or business clients of the bank. Stores demographic details, KYC status, risk rating, occupation, and country. Used to assess customer risk and monitor for suspicious activity.

- **accounts**: Represents bank accounts (savings, current, etc.) held by customers. Tracks account type, status, opening/closing dates, and branch association. Used to link transactions and monitor account-level activity.

- **transactions**: Records all financial transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers) performed on accounts. Includes transaction type, amount, channel, counterparty details, and currency. Central to detecting suspicious patterns and flows of funds.

- **branches**: Represents physical or virtual bank branches. Stores branch name, location, and country. Used for branch-level risk analysis and to associate accounts with locations.

- **alerts**: Captures AML alerts generated by monitoring systems or investigators. Links to customers, accounts, and transactions. Tracks alert type, status, and investigator. Used for case management and regulatory reporting.

- **countries**: Reference table for country information, including whether a country is considered high-risk for money laundering. Used for geographic risk analysis and transaction monitoring.

- **kyc_updates**: Tracks the history of KYC (Know Your Customer) updates for each customer. Records update date, status, and who performed the update. Used to ensure compliance and monitor for repeated KYC failures.

## 2. Entity Relationships
- Each customer can have multiple accounts.
- Each account belongs to one customer and one branch.
- Each transaction is linked to an account (and may reference a counterparty account/bank).
- Each alert can be linked to a customer, account, and/or transaction.
- Each customer and transaction is associated with a country (for risk analysis).
- KYC updates are linked to customers.

## 4. Action Flow Diagrams (Text Representation)

### a. Structuring (Smurfing)
1. Customer deposits multiple small amounts just below the reporting threshold.
2. System aggregates transactions by customer/account and time window.
3. If pattern detected, generate alert.
4. Investigator reviews alert and takes action.

**If not handled:** Large illicit funds may go undetected, exposing the bank to regulatory penalties.

---

### b. Rapid Movement of Funds (Layering)
1. Customer/account receives funds and quickly transfers them to other accounts/banks/countries.
2. System monitors for rapid in-and-out transactions, especially with high-risk countries.
3. If suspicious, generate alert.
4. Investigator reviews and escalates if needed.

**If not handled:** Illicit funds can be laundered through complex layers, making recovery and investigation difficult.

---

### c. Dormant Account Reactivation
1. Dormant account suddenly becomes active with large/unusual transactions.
2. System flags sudden activity spikes after inactivity.
3. Alert generated for review.

**If not handled:** Criminals may exploit dormant accounts to move illicit funds unnoticed.

---

### d. Unusual Beneficiary Patterns
1. Customer frequently changes beneficiaries or transfers to unrelated parties.
2. System tracks beneficiary changes and transfer patterns.
3. Suspicious activity triggers alert.

**If not handled:** True recipients of illicit funds may be hidden, complicating investigations.

---

### e. High-Risk Country Transactions
1. Transactions to/from high-risk countries are monitored.
2. System flags high-value or frequent transactions involving these countries.
3. Alerts generated for enhanced due diligence.

**If not handled:** Bank may inadvertently facilitate international money laundering.

---

### f. Repeated Failed KYC Updates
1. Customer fails to update KYC information multiple times.
2. System tracks KYC update attempts and failures.
3. Repeated failures trigger alert for review.

**If not handled:** Non-compliant customers may continue to transact, increasing regulatory and operational risk.
